NUMBER GUESSING GAME
This is a fun console-based game where players try to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts based on the selected difficulty level.

FEATURE
- Choose from three difficulty levels:
  - Easy: 10 attempts
  - Medium: 5 attempts
  - Hard: 3 attempts
- The game provides feedback on whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the target number.
- Players can choose to play again after each round.

GAME RULES
1. Select a difficulty level to determine the number of attempts.
2. Enter your guess for the number between 1 and 100.
3. The game will provide hints if your guess is too high or too low.
4. You win if you guess the number within the allotted attempts; otherwise, the correct number will be revealed.
